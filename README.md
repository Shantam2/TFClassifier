# TFClassifier


Built a classifier for houses. The housing data contains features for each house like # of bathrooms, price, and area. Manually added labels to my data (good buy or bad buy) then given a new house, predicted whether or not it's a good buy or bad buy using gradient descent as our optimization strategy
